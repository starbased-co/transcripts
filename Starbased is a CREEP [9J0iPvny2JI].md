- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=0) **Mrow**: So my guess is that I bullied him in J-Stocks, I ignored his Bullox, Doc's shed, I ignored him on his Starbase account, and then ultimately I banned him from chat and like that was the final straw for him. He was convinced because I didn't want this freak around that I'm like evil. I'm guessing I legitimately have no fucking clue. Like I love, like dude, I like This is the guy. This is, this is, and you're complaining about me. And you're complaining about me. This guy's so retarded. I don't understand. People being upset that this guy is DMing a 16 year old, trying to isolate them and trying to become a person of authority, you know, to them. Like, hey, come to me. Come to me if something bad is happening. that's like, yeah, people. I was. I was relatively active in, like, the j-stocks fear a couple months ago and super quick tl dr. Paragon, as far as my understanding goes, okay. Paragon sent an unconsensual dick pic to some girl in JSTOCK server and then like had a meltdown over it. And he like- Some of these- Do you guys know who Lavlune is? I've talked about Lavlune before. Some of these DMs are crazy. Now, I don't know if she's deleted her side. It's way funnier, way significantly funnier to assume that he didn't, but he's just talking to himself. Like, throughout all of these chats. She's so dry. You beat Spinboy, question mark. I heard you bullied him. Yeah, scroll up. Dude. Why do you need a- what is this? What is this? He's just to chat with somebody, you know. He farmed both of you and Zoe. He made both of you lol cows. Zoe is the girl that he sent an unconsensual dick pic to, by the way. All right, so this guy, whenever he's saying like, Oh, Zoe's evil. Zoe's ontologically evil whenever he's saying anything like that. He's just essentially, right? From my perspective, in my opinion, whatever. He essentially is just trying to smear this girl. So he's not being made fun of for sending like a dick pic to a random girl, basically. Like, look at all this. You good today, Miss LavLune? Yeah, pair. Thank you, heart. And he sends this. Glad to hear. Good luck today. I'm in SF today for work plus haircut. I took Pon-Pon with me secretly. This is a 30-year-old man obsessively like, Obsessed with like loli characters. He's obsessed with like discord relationships. Okay, this guy is crazy. And Parapon. Or Paragon, sorry. And Paragon is fucking insane. Okay, again, TLDR and I'm not gonna bring up any screenshots for this because I don't even know where I would go to begin to even find some of this shit. Uh, he would. I would just make fun of him in Jay-Stars because it's funny. It's funny that this guy like sent a girl his cock. It's not like the end of the world or anything. It's not like significantly crazy. It's mostly fine what happened realistically. Like, oh, a girl saw a fucking cock. Who cares, right? Block the guy if you didn't want to see it. You know, maybe out him if it wasn't consensual, stuff like that. Who cares? Realistically, it's not like the end of the world.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=261) **B**: It's not something you should want to.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=262) **Mrow**: Be doing, granted, right? But I would just make fun of this guy. I would bully him just for fun. There was no real like rhyme or reason behind it. I just thought the guy was funny to fuck with. And then he DMs me on Twitter. Unbeknownst to me, at this point, I'm pretty sure he got banned from like everybody's Discord, which is why he couldn't message me on Discord. He got banned from like everybody's Discord. and he messages me on Twitter. I don't even think it was my Liquid Morale account. I think Liquid Morale came after an account got banned or something like that. And he DMed me and he was like, Dude, I have Bow Blacks and his sister's dogs. And he sends me Bow Blacks and his sister's like full name and address and like workplace or some shit. And he's like, you got to cover this on stream. And I'm like, huh? What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? What do you mean? And unbeknownst to me, I learned today, at this point, he had DMed Mr. Girl, Bob Black's Docs for some fucking reason. Bob Black's sister's Docs for some fucking reason. I don't know. I don't know why. I don't know why. And then this guy, after being banned from Mr. Girl, all everybody's Discord basically, his final effort to get people to cover Bob Black's Docs for some fucking reason, is to DM Mrau. He goes to me, his final, his last ditch effort, is to come to me to try to get me to cover Bob Blacks' docks. I don't fucking know what I was supposed to, how am I supposed to cover a dock? Like, look at this house this guy has, look at his name, like, what the fuck am I supposed to do there? I don't know. I, I, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Okay? So I've been trying to like theorize why this guy, like, wants me dead, why this guy fucking hates me so much. And if I go to my DMs with him on Discord, he sent me like a wall of text that I just haven't responded to that goes on for like weeks. He's like been DMing me and I just I didn't accept the DM request, right? So my guess is that I I bullied him in J-Stocks. I ignored his Bulleblacks, Docs shit. I ignored him on his Starbase account. And then ultimately I banned him from chat and like that was the final straw for him. He was convinced because I didn't want this freak around that I'm like evil. I'm guessing, I legitimately have no fucking clue. And then there's these screenshots. Technically I was Starbashed before Paragon. this is my OG account. But I made my other account when I was streaming in 2019. Any cents after that? Okay, like two, three hours later, it looks like. Unless it's like a different time zone or something. Anyways, I'm gonna go. All this stuff with Aiden and Perry is not sitting well with me. And I said I would take a break. I'm gonna grab a cigarette with my bud before I go. Guys, do not makes California wire tapping laws with minors.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=446) **B**: It's us.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=448) **Mrow**: This guy's doing, like, exactly what major Wendy did, by the way, where he's like, I actually don't care. I gotta go take a break. I'm like, he never does. It's. This is just so bizarre. This is so bizarre. This entire situation. Okay, now, to be clear, I'm not gonna cry on my knees. Oh, oh, Discord girl leaked my sex. Like, yeah, it sucks. Obviously, it sucks. I would rather that not have happened. But like, realistically, ok, I, you know, I thought I knew what I was getting into, ok, I can't complain that much. I will say, however, how everybody has behaved in this is just fucking crazy, right? Because apparently, this literally goes so far back as to like the, the Minecraft bed drama where Perry was trying to leak a call with like him and Babka, and Parapon. And they had to DM him. They're like, don't leak this, don't leak this. And like they were both freaking out. So like this Parry guy legitimately lacks like any fucking social skills at all. Let's go, Wendy returns. Is Wendy back? That's epic. That's epic. And then like he again without permission leaks more shit when it's like, okay, like listen, Discord sex are not like, extremely confidential. Like, yeah, they're probably gonna get out, you know, they're probably gonna get out. Okay. They're probably gonna get out. Who cares? I mean, I care. I care. Okay. I'm crying and stuff. All right. And then, like, Perry just starts leaking, and, like, yesterday, I'm not gonna pull up the clip. I don't have the time stamp. Apparently he DMD Queenan and is like, He just started telling QuemAn like, hey, this is what Mira's into. You should out this. Don't tell anybody it's coming from me though. And it's like, dude, this guy is such a fucking weirdo. This guy is like, Jesus fucking Christ. This is like so bizarre. Listen, bully people for whatever the fuck you want. Bully people for whatever the fuck you want. If someone finds what I'm into weird, yeah, who cares? Make your jokes, do whatever, I don't give a fuck. But like going into the DMS of a YouTuber and saying, Hey, out this shit. Don't say it's from me, though. That's that's so fucking bizarre to me. I'll never understand that. And obviously I want to speculate, you know, the whole like, you know, I fucking cucked Perry and he's pissed at me because I, you know, did whatever. I really don't know. Why? Like, does Perry Leg is. Does he just think it's funny? Like, realistically, Perry could just think it's, like, funny, right? To be fair, it was already out. I'm pretty sure he. He dm'd Queman. Like, yes, he does. Perry thinks this is hilarious. True. I don't exactly know the full timeline, but yeah, it's just like, dude, this is so fucking retarded. But again, to be clear, I'm not complaining super hard. Obviously, I had this coming, right? I can't exactly complain, right? Granted, I'm not exactly happy it's all out there. But I find I find solace in the fact that this was definitely not an e-rape and it definitely was reciprocated and encouraged. I suppose, I guess.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=676) **B**: Right.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=678) **Mrow**: I don't even know what else there is to say. Like, yeah, it sucks. It's retarded, but it's kind of it. It is what it is that happened, you know? Hey, man, at least you didn't say penetrate the shyness or something. What I have said is significantly worse. What I have said is significantly worse than that. Significantly worse than that. Like if the, I come off as like a white nationalist, dude. It's bad. It's bad. Okay. the star-based hater DMS.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=732) **B**: Yeah.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=732) **Mrow**: If I can find those real quick, I'll. I'll grab them. Does anybody have the full Starbase DMs that they can grab for me? I'm trying to scroll to find where those would be posted. I'm probably gonna have to go to a stream to find them. yeah, but, like, dude, like, to talk more on this guy, like, this guy was basically, as far as I understand it, he was trying to out me as for being, like, a sex pest.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=807) **B**: Which.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=809) **Mrow**: Is like, who cares? Or not even who cares, I mean sure probably some people care, but like everybody fucking knows. Literally the only reason people know me pretty much is because of like the dramas that I've been in surrounding that shit. So it's kind of like, yeah, okay. Yeah, I am. What do you want me to say? You want me to fucking deny it? Yeah, I'm a fucking, I'm a weird Discord freak, okay? The only difference, the only thing that changes me from like a normal Discord freak is I make like YouTube videos. All right, which makes me arguably worse, OK? There's like two significant mental illnesses wanting to make YouTube content and wanting to message Discord women. Both of those things are already extraordinarily egregious, OK? So combine them, there's probably something, listen, all right, when they autopsy my fucking dead body after I kill myself, they open up my brain, OK? They look at the fuck, they peek in, they peel back the curtain, my brain flaps. They see the synapses and they're going to find some insane shit in there, I'm sure. All right. It's like he's just hot sibling sex, siblings breeding. Like, is this the guy you want DMing the 16 year old to be like, Hey, hey, man. Hey, man. Like, if you ever if you ever need someone to talk to, you can come to me, you know? like, I love, like, dude, I like, this is the guy. This is, this is, and you're complaining about me. And you're complaining about me. This guy's so retarded. I don't understand. Like, listen, you can criticize me as much as you want for, like, being reckless online and, like, dming women. Obviously, like, I can't even deny that there's literally like, what am I supposed to say to that? Like, yeah, I do, right? But holy. Like, dude, this, like, no, I. This is crazy. This is just so bizarre. This guy's so bizarre. Okay. and I know Aiden covered up. Was it on this stream? Probably was. Let me find this. Is this it? Got the resolution so. Dude, I can't even see the fucking messages. Hold on, I might have sent them to someone. Let me see if I've sent them to someone. Hold on, who would I have sent these to? Who would I have sent these to? Let me find. I was talking to someone about this. I didn't send it to this person. I I I don't know who I would have sent this to in the beginning of the VOD. No, I I. Okay, it's right here. Sure.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1033) **B**: Hater that if she...
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1034) **Aiden**: The resolution's so fucked.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1037) **Mrow**: She gets... Oh my god. He redacted Parry's portion of these DMs.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1041) **Aiden**: By... Full disclosure, I told Hater that.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1045) **Mrow**: If she gets into trouble again, she can come to me instead of having to deliberate with a bunch of autistic adults. Wow.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1052) **Aiden**: Full disclosure, I told Hater that if she gets in trouble again, she can come to me instead of having to deliberate with a bunch of autistic adults. Hi, I just wanted to add you so you can contact me if you get in trouble again with someone like QQ.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1066) **Mrow**: Also, this has already been talked about for a few days, so I know I'm re-litigating shit that everybody else is pretty much covered. What the fuck did QQ do? QQ was trying to get this person banned from adult spaces, star-based, okay? And the calls that we're gonna listen to. is essentially saying like, I don't like how these spaces are allowing minors. QQ was throwing a fit because Hater was in these servers and in these spaces and they were 16. Why is he being upset with QQ here? QQ is on Starbase side principally. This is so retarded. This is so fucking stupid. This makes literally no fucking sense.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1110) **Aiden**: I hate QQ. Yeah, if an adult keeps messing with you, just hit me up so we can handle it discreetly.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1118) **Mrow**: How the fuck is this guy going to handle anything?
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1121) **Aiden**: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Starbase is 30 years old, right?
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1128) **Mrow**: I'm- I mean, yeah, I mean, we just saw the DMs, okay? We just saw the DMs. Listen, knowing- knowing what we know now about Starbase, okay? knowing what we know now that this is Paragon. Yeah, people. People. People being upset that this guy is dming a 16 year old trying to isolate them and trying to become a thor. A person of authority. you know, to them, like, hey, come to me. Come to me if something bad is happening. That's like. Yeah, people are warranted. People are warranted in being a little upset here. Okay. Starbase just saw her as a little sister. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1194) **B**: All right.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1194) **Mrow**: I mean, there's more of these DMS, but it's just like he's literally just, like, talking to his self. He's like, dude, what is going on here? Oh, wait, what's going on here? OMG. I wish you were in the server still. So bad. Zoe tried to snake me, and I counter snaked her. W. I'm the winner of public opinion. I saw all your messages, dude. You're a freak. Don't come crawling to me. Crawling? What do you mean? Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Crawling? What do you mean? I'm high off winning. I found J-Stark right around when you first came on, and this was a chill place. Even a little community of people started forming around you. I don't know why Destiny let you back into his sphere. If he was just going to stomp on your sandcastle, I didn't do anything to gain your favor. I never asked anything from you. What all that I'm dealing with my IRL romantic life right now, it's so ridiculous. People think I did it because I'm horny. They can't imagine what it's like to have an actual sex life. So this is their best chance at it. I saw your messages to her about me. Why are you messaging me? Like, dude, care. This guy supposedly has a girlfriend. He's claimed recently that he has a girlfriend. So, like, is this, like, right after he's sending his cock online unconsensually to some random girl he just met? Is he then immediately getting into a relationship? Is this, like, a cheating situation? Like, there's so many questions here, dude. This is ridiculous. This is so insane. This is so fucking insane. And then he replies with, like.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1337) **B**: I.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1338) **Mrow**: Wanted to have a post-drama retrospective. What I was persuading her to do was counterproductive to herself. And a benefit to you. I'm 100% confident that if we go to where- I'm- fuck Jesus Christ, I'm 100% confident that if we were to go over a debate, it would show that. Example, when I told her not to call your bluff, I don't even know if you were bluffing. How could I? But if she kept going, okay, I mean, like, dude, you get the fucking point. This guy's like, I don't have to read this all. This guy's fucking weird. And now he's like sending baby Peach DMs. It's like, she's my friend. Not good. Here's the text. Exaggeration. Like, dude, this guy is worried about me DMing people being fucking weird. That's what this whole drama was, ok? That's what this entire fucking drama was. This guy was worried that I was going to be a danger to people or a danger to women in this space or whatever the fuck. First of all, most women in this space would rather me not DM them. OK, so first of all, if I were to DM most women here, they'd probably just leak my shit instantly and, like, make fun of me. OK, so I don't even know who the fuck I could prey upon if that were even my intention. All right, this is fucking ridiculous. And, like, this guy's being an insane freak. He's posting, like, insane fucking memes. and just being sexually explicit, being outwardly, like, almost pro-Loli, right? Constantly posting, like, Loli memes, Loli images, constantly, like, role playing as a pedophile. And then he thinks that he's the one, like, I got to DM this 16 year old to protect them. It's like, dude, like, this is. I'm not going to act like I'm, like, a fucking. Some like insanely cool person like I'm a fucking freak. All right? I'm not going to I'm not going to lie. Okay? Okay. I'm considering Christianity or something. Okay. I've been talking to Max. I've been talking to Max. All right. MRAU religion. MRAU is joining a religion sometime soon probably. But like being worried about me when you have this shit in your closet is just so bizarre. Like this guy made a new fucking account because he got bullied off the internet because he started sending people fucking BowBlacks Docs. What is he thinking? What the fuck is this guy thinking? He got bullied and banned everywhere because he started basically spamming everybody with BowBlacks Docs. And then he's afraid that I'm gonna be a danger. This guy spreads fucking doxes. This is insane. This is fucking crazy. okay, this is insane. Christ is King. True, true. We met at a kick stream where he basically discovered all this. I'll just TLDR. You guys can go watch it if you want to. When Paragon stopped posting, Starbase started posting. There's a bunch of other shit. They sound exactly the same, which is why in this stream I have four VODs from J-Stalk that I'm thinking we look at. I'm thinking we do some sort of Paragon marathon. All right, I'm thinking that's the name that we call this stream. All right, some sort of Paragon marathon. And we look at this guy's entire history in J-Stark's community. And we determine, I think at the end, I think at the end we're going to determine, we're going to, I'll do a poll, I'll do a poll in chat. We can determine, ok, we can check, we can see after all we've seen, would you be comfortable with this 30 year old man DMing a 16 year old and forming a private, exclusive relationship and establishing himself as a form of authority to the minor. All right, I'm thinking that's what we do. What do we think? What do we think? I'm thinking we go through hours upon hours upon hours of content. Paragon is star-based yep. Yes, he is. I'm thinking we go over hours and hours and hours of content. to determine if we would be comfortable having this guy DM, you know, the minor. A minor. A minor. Kendrick Lamar. All right. Anyways, I'm gonna go like, dude, this guy's such a weirdo. And again, I want to make it abundantly clear, say. Whatever the fuck you want about me, okay? I have undoubtedly done some freak shit, and I will probably continue to be doing some freak shit. Admittedly, okay? Admittedly. Um, however, I don't think I'm to this level. I don't think I would ever unconsensually, you know, send a fucking picture. Which again, one of the things that Starbase was mad about. Is that apparently I was doing unconsensual roleplay, like rape roleplay, or like unconsensual race play or whatever the fuck. And then in his closet, he's like-- he's not even doing roleplay, he's just unconsensually sending his fucking cock to people.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1690) **B**: First off, it's not even true that.
- [link](youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iPvny2JI&t=1692) **Mrow**: I was doing anything unconsensually. That's a fucking lie. That's an outright lie. I don't know why he decided to lie about that. And then furthermore, in his closet, he's legitimately done unconsensual, unwanted sexual sexual acts where he's sending people his fucking cock. So it's like, again, say what you want about me. I literally cannot fight the criticism to be had about being a fucking freak. There's nothing I can do, you know, to fight that. Like, yeah, it's it's it's true. I'm sorry. It's true. Okay. But regardless of that, like this is the guy trying to fucking crusade against me. To be clear, the criticism is valid. I'm a fucking freak. I want to make that abundantly clear. I'm not trying to like discount this entirely. You know, I'm not trying to discount this entirely by saying like, look at the guy who's spreading this or whatever. You know, if you think the criticism is valid, you think the criticism is valid, what can you do?
